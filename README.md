# Artwork-Data-Dao
This repo is about Artworks Data DAO on the Filecoin network, creating a decentralized platform for artists, collectors, and enthusiasts to manage,
incentivize, and invest in artworks.  The DAO will leverage the benefits of fvm to ensure secure and transparent management of artwork data.
This project is made for the HackFS-2023 hackathon by ETHGlobal.
